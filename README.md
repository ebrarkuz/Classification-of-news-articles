# Machine Learning Project 
# News Article Classification with Naive Bayes

## Project Objective
The purpose of this project is to classify English news articles into five categories: Sport, Business, Politics, Entertainment, and Tech. The main objective is to understand and apply the Naive Bayes algorithm for text classification.

## Methods and Techniques
- Naive Bayes classifier implemented from scratch  
- Bag of Words (BoW) representation  
  - Unigram model  
  - Bigram model  
- Laplace smoothing for unseen words  
- Log-probability calculations to avoid numerical underflow  
- TF-IDF and feature selection for word importance analysis  
- Stopword analysis using English stopwords  
- Accuracy as the evaluation metric
